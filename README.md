## ‚û§ Future plans
Due to the lack of experience we haven't managed to successfully integrate it with Azure and deploy it but we're looking forward to improve our project!
Our future plans are:
- [ ] Azure integration;
- [ ] Adding data storage;
- [ ] Better natural disaster news aggregation;
- [ ] Retraining neural network to be able to detect other objects and show more detailed information about damage;
- [ ] Azure/DigiatOcean Deployment
